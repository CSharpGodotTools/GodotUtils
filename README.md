## Thinking of Adding
- 3D Scripts
- Inventory Script(s) / Prefab(s)
- Modular Mod Manager Logic and UI
- Procedurally generated tech tree

## Install
Add this as a submodule to your GitHub repo
```
git submodule add https://github.com/Valks-Games/GodotUtils GodotUtils
```

Add the following to your `.csproj`
```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ENet-CSharp" Version="2.4.8" />
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
