## What is this?
A utils library for Godot 4 C# RC5+

## Multiplayer
Please have a look at https://github.com/Valks-Games/Multiplayer-Template

## Features
There is a lot of stuff in this library. I feel like if I document it here, it's just going to change later. So I'll leave it up to the reader to explore the source themselves.

## Install
Add this as a submodule to your GitHub repo
```
git submodule add https://github.com/Valks-Games/GodotUtils GodotUtils
```

Make sure this is in your `.csproj`
```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```
